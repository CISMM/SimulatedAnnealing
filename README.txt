SimulatedAnnealing
==================

This is an updated version of Everett Carter's simulated annealing library ported to more modern C++.

The original library source can be found at:
ftp://ftp.taygeta.com/pub/c++/simanneal.tar.Z

The original also includes C and Ada code, but that was removed since we only needed the C++ and do not wish to update the others.

The original README can be found in README-orig.txt and contains directions for use of the package.  Note that it contains directions for C and Ada code that is not included in this derivative.  Only the C++ code from this library is included here.
